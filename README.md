## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database URL (PostgreSQL/SQLite) | No | `postgresql://user:pass@localhost/loopin` |
| `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key for sessions | Yes | `your-super-secret-key` |
| `FLASK_ENV` | Environment (development/production) | No | `production` |
| `PORT` | Port number (default: 8000) | No | `8000` |

### Database Setup

The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM with support for PostgreSQL and SQLite. If `DATABASE_URL` is not set, it will default to using a local SQLite database.

Database migrations are handled through Flask-Migrate:

```bash
# Initialize database schema
flask db upgrade
```

### Backup & Restore System

LoopIn includes a comprehensive backup and restore system optimized for Railway PostgreSQL:

#### Features
- **Complete Database Backup**: Full PostgreSQL database dumps with metadata
- **Archived Items Handling**: Properly backs up and restores archived content
- **Railway Optimized**: Uses proper psql/pg_restore command structures
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress indicators during restore
- **Data Integrity**: Automatic verification and cleanup after restore

#### Backup Operations
```bash
# Create manual backup
python -c "from backup_system import DatabaseBackupSystem; bs = DatabaseBackupSystem(); bs.create_backup('manual')"

# Create scheduled backup
python scheduled_backup.py daily
```

#### Restore Operations
```bash
# Restore from backup (handled through web interface)
# Access: /backup in admin panel
```

#### Backup Files
- **Format**: PostgreSQL SQL dumps (.sql) and custom format (.dump)
- **Metadata**: JSON files with backup information and archived items count
- **Location**: `backups/` directory with automatic cleanup

### Testing Setup

Run tests with the standard pytest command:
```bash
python -m pytest
```

This will use a temporary SQLite database for testing to protect production data.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Memory Issues (SIGKILL)
**Issue**: Worker killed with SIGKILL! Perhaps out of memory?
**Solution**: Memory optimization applied - check /health endpoint for current usage

**Issue**: Railway deployment fails due to memory constraints
**Solution**:
- Configuration optimized for 512MB-1GB Railway instances
- Reduced workers from 7+ to 2 (60-70% memory reduction)
- Switched from eventlet to gevent for better memory efficiency
- Added memory monitoring to health endpoint

#### Backup/Restore Problems
**Issue**: Restore operation hangs or fails
**Solution**: Check Railway PostgreSQL compatibility - ensure proper DATABASE_URL format

**Issue**: Archived items not restored to original locations
**Solution**: Use backup files created with v2.0+ of the backup system (includes metadata)

#### JavaScript Issues
**Issue**: 24-hour update highlighting not working
**Solution**: Check browser console for timestamp parsing errors - ensure proper date format

#### Database Connection Issues
**Issue**: Connection timeouts or authentication failures
**Solution**:
```bash
# Test connection manually
psql -h your-host -p your-port -U your-user -d your-database -c "SELECT 1;"
```

#### Performance Monitoring
**Check Memory Usage**:
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
# Returns memory usage in MB and percentage
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Database
- Connection pooling configured for Railway PostgreSQL
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Background job processing for heavy operations

#### Frontend
- Lazy loading for large content
- Optimized asset delivery
- Responsive design for all devices
